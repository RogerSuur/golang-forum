Make EDIT post btn + handler
+ that takes you to the new post form 
+ take that posts POstID
+ query that post info from backend


If PostAuthorID = SesstionData.UserID
DOnt show likes or dislike btn, nor comment

Position the edit button better

Check if the Post.PostAuthorID == SessionData.
Then show Edit btn







STYLE mark as read btn (maybe even as a delete btn)




CANCEL: Redirect at deletenotification to the correct page at userpage notifications(IMPOSSIBLE)




Adding btn to each notification to delete them

btn takes us to handler
handler takes that notfication and deletes it from database
then it sends refreshes the page for client
(a ka redirects them)

For deleteing notifications, notificationID would help



Maybe create an universal handler for deleting both posts and notifications?


Displaying notifications 

Create datatype for notifications
Fill NotificationsData struct fields
Create place in html








Statements done, except DELETE(later for removing notifications)







With each comment or like, get Post author ID.
Make a notification post request to that author.

Add a notification droplist to userpage, which shows
notifications on a droplist and links to those posts.

Notification comes with a table notifications
Columns: from_user(reactor), to_user(author), type(comment/like)


MAKE IT ALL ON WEBSOCKET OR NOT? NOT

1) Notifications table
2) statements remove, change



3) handler to insert notifications db on post like/comment

NEED TO SEPARATE COMMENT FROM POSTS

DOES IT NEED AUTOINCREMENTING ID?


4) displaying notifications 

Create datatype for notifications
Fill NotificationsData struct fields
Create place in html
