This project will add userpage with advanced features
to Go forum project. 

    It notifies users when their posts are :
        liked/disliked
        commented

It has an activity page that tracks the user own activity. In other words, a page that :

    Shows the user created posts
    Shows where the user left a like or a dislike
    Shows where and what the user has been commenting. For this, the comment will have to be shown, as well as the post commented

It has a section where you will be able to Edit/Remove posts and comments.
